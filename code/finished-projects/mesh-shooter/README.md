This project is still in progress and **not** yet complete.

# Rotating Cube

This project demonstrates a basic Vulkan application integrated with the PhysX library for physics simulation. The main goal of this project is to provide a fundamental understanding of Vulkan by showcasing a simple interactive effect where players can shoot convex polyhedrons at a large convex polyhedron with free FPS camera movement. Each time the application runs, the polyhedrons you see are randomly generated and form convex meshes.

## Known Inefficiencies

The current implementation still has some inefficiencies related to memory management. The project setup involves separate blocks for buffers and memories, which could be streamlined in future updates to enhance rendering efficiency.

## Requirements

- A system with Vulkan-compatible hardware
- CMake version 3.10+
- Vulkan SDK installed
- GLFW3 installed
- glm installed
- C++17-compatible compiler

## Building
```bat

REM coming soon
