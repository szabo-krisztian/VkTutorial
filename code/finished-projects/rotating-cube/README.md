# Mesh Shooter

 This project demonstrates a basic Vulkan application integrated with the PhysX library for physics simulation. The main goal of this project is to provide a fundamental understanding of Vulkans by showcasing a simple interactive effect where players can shoot convex polyhedrons at a large polyhedron with free FPS camera movement. I tried to make as many abstractions as necessary while keeping them as minimal as possible.
