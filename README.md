# Vulkan API Tutorial

Welcome to my Vulkan API tutorial repository! This repository represents my personal learning curve with the Vulkan API. I have compiled this as a resource to share my journey and potentially help others who are also navigating the complexities of Vulkan. I try to keep my study ongoing and upload, improve my code every day.

## Introduction

Vulkan is a low-level, low-overhead cross-platform API and open standard for 3D graphics and computing. It was intended to address the shortcomings of OpenGL, and allow developers more control over the GPU. It is designed to support a wide variety of GPUs, CPUs and operating systems, and it is also designed to work with modern multi-core CPUs. Learning Vulkan can be quite challenging due to its complexity and depth, but it offers powerful tools for creating high-performance graphics applications. 

## About the Repository

This repository contains tutorials, examples, and experiments that I have created while learning the Vulkan API. It is not production-ready and may contain numerous bugs and inefficiencies. However, I have made it public with the hope that others may find useful ideas and learn from my experiences.

## Learning Resources

Here is a comprehensive list of resources that have been instrumental in my learning journey:

### Books
- **"Real-Time Rendering, Fourth Edition"** by Tomas Akenine-MÃ¶ller, Eric Haines, Naty Hoffman: An authoritative guide on the theory and practice of real-time rendering.

- **"Foundations of Game Engine Development, Volume 2: Rendering"** by Eric Lengyel: A detailed guide on rendering techniques for game engines.
